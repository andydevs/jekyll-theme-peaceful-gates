    A repository of jupyter notebooks I'm working on or have worked on
    exploring programming, scientific computing, data science, and other
    topics that I could make a jupyter notebook for. I've also linked it 
    in the side panel of this website as I plan to make corresponding
    notebooks for some blog posts. And yes I did make an entire static
    site generator for the website.

    mushroom. The model was trained on a kaggle dataset of mushroom data.

- name: Memes R' Us
  description: >
    This is not an actual retail site. First off, memes are free. Anyone who is 
    telling you otherwise is ripping you off. Second, the site isn't really fully
    functional, let alone clean. I made it in the better half of a week
    so I was rushing. This was mainly a project to more familiarize myself 
    with the Stripe payment system, especially in the context of an ecommerce
    site. Again, you want memes, go to reddit... or even instagram. Never buy
    them. It is illegal to sell memes... I think.
